0. Add comments to the source files identifying the exercises for which they are solutions.  (Status: partial.)

1. Add a coverage tool, and write unit tests for earlier exercises which had none.  (Status: done.)

2. Create a Makefile target that runs all the tests. (Status: done)

3. Analyze source with clang-tidy and/or "gcc -fanalyzer" (https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/7/contributions/721/)

4. Try microbenchmarking tools (https://www.bfilipek.com/2016/01/micro-benchmarking-libraries-for-c.html)

5. Migrate ACCU- and BPF-related code to a new Github repo (done).

6. Get rid of operator new in favor of RAII.

7. Replace raw pointers with smart pointers.

8. After getting rid of operator new, check all tests for memory leaks with valgrind.

9. Make move() constructors standards-compliant; avoid undefined behavior.
